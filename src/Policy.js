In the rare


ses, a shipment can be stuck in customs and may need a declaration or additional documents from your side. If you are failed to provide the requested declaration or additional documents then we will not be able to offer any refund from our side because the shipment will be confiscated by the customs authorities.

In the unlikely event, if there are chances that shipment can be returned back to the origin due to incomplete documents from the consignee, then we may refund you the product cost only.

forecastmall Import Fees Deposit

forecastmall offers customers customs duties, taxes, and fees ("Import Fees") estimation during checkout and customs clearance on your behalf for certain eligible countries and regions.

 

<h5>Calculating Fees</h5>

When you order products from forecastmall, an estimate of the Import Fees will be levied on all items. With your authorization, these funds are used by the carrier or another agent to pay the Import Fees on your behalf (or the recipients behalf) to the appropriate authorities of the destination country ("Import Fees Deposit"). The payment of import fees is the responsibility of the importer and is levied based on the laws of the country into which the products are being shipped.

Import Fees Deposits will vary depending on the selected product and shipping method. The Import Fees Deposit is an estimation of the taxes and duties that may apply and isn't an actual calculation. Customs regulations and tax rates applicable to certain goods may change between the date the taxes and duties were estimated and the applicable taxes and duties on the date of import into the destination country. The duty or tax rate is often determined by the classification of a good, which varies by country and region.

Duties and taxes are calculated based on the market value (actual price before any promotions) of the product and not the price after forecastmall promotions. This allows destination country customs authorities to obtain the accurate import duties and taxes owed to them based on the actual value of the goods.

You won't be charged


fees if the actual Import Fees exceed the Import Fees Deposit we estimated. In that case,  forecastmall will pay the exceeded fees. And if the actual Import Fees are less than the Import Fees Deposit collected by us on your behalf then there will be no refund which means the customs duty charges you paid to us are non-reversible.

<h5>Note</h5> : The cost to ship items from each product category to international destinations varies by item, shipment, and shipping option.

The above terms also apply to the shipment of any replacement product (if applicable) that might be shipped if there's a problem with the original shipment.
 

Shipping policies for countries where customs charges are excluded

For some countries, we do not charge customs upfront and consignee needs to pay customs charges at the time of customs clearance. The shipping company will share the sum that the consignee must pay, and the consignee should pay this amount to the shipping company, who will then hand it over to the customs authority on the consignee's behalf.

Depending on the product packaging, the consignee can receive multiple shipments for a single order; customs charges will be applied to the shipments accordingly.
